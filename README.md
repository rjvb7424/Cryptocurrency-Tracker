# Cryptocurrency Price Tracker

This application fetches the latest prices of selected cryptocurrencies from the [Coinlayer API](https://coinlayer.com/) and displays them in a simple Tkinter-based GUI. The displayed prices automatically update at a regular interval (every 10 seconds by default).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple Tkinter GUI with clear labels and indicators for price changes.
- **Trend Indicators**: Displays an up arrow ("↑") in green if the price has increased, a down arrow ("↓") in red if the price has decreased, and a dash ("-") in white if the price is unchanged since the last update.
